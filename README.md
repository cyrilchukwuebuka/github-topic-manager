# TOPIC MANAGER  
This project streamlines the process of adding or removal of Topics by developers and github users to one or more github repositories.  

With topics, exploring repositories in a particular subject area, finding projects to contribute to, and discovering new solutions to a specific problem becomes easy.  

Topics appear on the main page of a repository. Clicking on a topic name refers you to see related topics and a list of other repositories classified with that topic.  

## TECHNOLOGIES USED  
*  [React](https://reactjs.org/)  
*  [React-redux (Redux-toolkit)](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
*  [React Reveal](https://www.react-reveal.com/)
*  [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)  
*  [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
